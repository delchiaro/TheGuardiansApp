    <string name="Text1Slide1">In 2013 I was presented with a tandem of incredible opportunities: design a symbol for Italy in NYC on the occasion of the Year of Italian Culture. And also a Public Art project in 3 Bryant Park in Manhattan. At the time, I was asked by the Italian Embassy to look at the Michelangeloâ€™s David as an inspiration. Clearly that magnum reference was daunting. Yet I was so honored to create a symbol that could represent a permanent gift from my native Italy to New York City, that I accepted the exceptional opportunity.

    The Bible tale of the young Israeli king David and the giant Goliath has galvanized generations. David defeats Goliath with his limitless faith. His spiritual impetus within wins over the physical terror spread by Goliath. Just like contemporary Superhero\'s tales, the battle versus the villain du jour is won after believing in oneself first. We all face some temporary existence Goliath.

    We have always celebrated, in civilizations around the globe, the myth of the superhuman and our ability to swell our limited physical condition with our limitless inner potency. I was inspired by that potency, I was inspired to materialize, in the hearth of Manhattan, that force with the history of the David that will always be actual. This is why I created the Hero.</string>
