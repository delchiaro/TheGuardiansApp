    <string name="Text1Slide1">In 2013 I was presented with a tandem of incredible opportunities: design a symbol for Italy in NYC on the occasion of the Year of Italian Culture. And also a Public Art project in 3 Bryant Park in Manhattan. At the time, I was asked by the Italian Embassy to look at the Michelangelo’s David as an inspiration. Clearly that magnum reference was daunting. Yet I was so honored to create a symbol that could represent a permanent gift from my native Italy to New York City, that I accepted the exceptional opportunity.
    \n\n
    The Bible tale of the young Israeli king David and the giant Goliath has galvanized generations. David defeats Goliath with his limitless faith. His spiritual impetus within wins over the physical terror spread by Goliath. Just like contemporary Superhero\'s tales, the battle versus the villain du jour is won after believing in oneself first. We all face some temporary existence Goliath.
    \n\n
    We have always celebrated, in civilizations around the globe, the myth of the superhuman and our ability to swell our limited physical condition with our limitless inner potency. I was inspired by that potency, I was inspired to materialize, in the hearth of Manhattan, that force with the history of the David that will always be actual. This is why I created the Hero.</string>
    <string name="Text1Slide2">The Guardians in New York City represent two symbolic protectors of the City that celebrate the superhuman and the inspiration that it channels. I wanted to create two symbolic Guardians: a Hero in marble stone, and a Superhero in mirror polished stainless steel.
         \n\n
         The two anthropomorphic sculptures that I have digitally generated are intended as two a layered architectural construction that display the universal ability of mankind to cement its own presence in the world with its perennial construction skills. The stack of materials creates layers and layers of traces of the movement of the body and the body\'s openness to its surroundings. The layers in the shape of slabs are stacked together with a complex static system.
         \n\n
         Everything starts with the body, with its focus and its ability to project itself serially in civilizations: from the early stone towers to the current steel skyscrapers. The architectural body is a vital trace we leave in the world and it is the perfect language to create the shape of an Hero.
        \n\n
     I never would have expected, two years later from the installation of the Guardians in NYC, to receive the great honor to see a new edition of “Hero” in the Accademia Gallery of Florence, in the same place as Michelangelo\’s “David.” This is the story of the actions of an Hero from the past that echoes in our present and in the future.</string>
