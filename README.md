This is a concept application for accessing cultural content in expositions:
base content is provided by the application once installed, but extra acontent can only be accessed once the exposition location is reached, 
thanks to an in site bluetooth beacon.

In this case, one can alternatively scan a specific QR-Code to unlock the extra content.
